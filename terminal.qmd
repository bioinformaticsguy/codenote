# SFTP Commands
## The Command


```bash
sftp -oPort=22 -oHostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa guest2@131.174.197.250

```

## üß† Why do we need -oHostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa?
üí° Problem:
Modern versions of OpenSSH (since v8.8) have disabled the ssh-rsa algorithm by default due to security concerns. So when a server only supports ssh-rsa (and not newer, safer algorithms), your SSH/SFTP client refuses to connect.
You were seeing an error like:

```code 
Unable to negotiate with 131.174.197.250 port 22: no matching host key type found. Their offer: ssh-rsa,ssh-dss
```

## üîê What this means:
The server only supports ssh-rsa or ssh-dss, both of which are considered old/insecure.

Your SSH client refused to accept them for security reasons.

## ‚úÖ What does -oHostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa do?
It tells your SSH/SFTP client:

"It's okay to accept and use ssh-rsa for host verification."

This lets you bypass the modern security restriction just for this connection, allowing it to proceed.


## üîí Security Note:
This is generally safe for trusted servers, especially in closed environments (like HPC systems).

But don‚Äôt use this option on unknown/public servers unless necessary, because older algorithms like ssh-rsa are more vulnerable to certain attacks.
