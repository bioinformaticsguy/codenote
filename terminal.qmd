# SFTP Commands
## The Command


```bash
sftp -oPort=22 -oHostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa guest2@131.174.197.250

```

## üß† Why do we need -oHostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa?
üí° Problem:
Modern versions of OpenSSH (since v8.8) have disabled the ssh-rsa algorithm by default due to security concerns. So when a server only supports ssh-rsa (and not newer, safer algorithms), your SSH/SFTP client refuses to connect.
You were seeing an error like:

```code 
Unable to negotiate with 131.174.197.250 port 22: no matching host key type found. Their offer: ssh-rsa,ssh-dss
```

## üîê What this means:
The server only supports ssh-rsa or ssh-dss, both of which are considered old/insecure.

Your SSH client refused to accept them for security reasons.

## ‚úÖ What does -oHostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa do?
It tells your SSH/SFTP client:

"It's okay to accept and use ssh-rsa for host verification."

This lets you bypass the modern security restriction just for this connection, allowing it to proceed.


## üîí Security Note:
This is generally safe for trusted servers, especially in closed environments (like HPC systems).

But don‚Äôt use this option on unknown/public servers unless necessary, because older algorithms like ssh-rsa are more vulnerable to certain attacks.

## Downloading the Folder in SFTP
```code
get -r foldername
```

# To download files from BIH
```python
rsync bihlogin1:/data/cephfs-1/home/users/alhassa_m/work/run_nf/rare/dag.png dag.png
```

# Speedey Downloads
```python
aria2c -x16 -s16 https://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-114/variation/indexed_vep_cache/homo_sapiens_vep_114_GRCh38.tar.gz
```


# Mounting the external drive in Ubuntu Terminal
```python
sudo mount -t drvfs E: /mnt/usb
```

# Uploading VIA rsync

```python
rsync -avh --progress /mnt/usb/X208SC25055632-Z01-F001_multipath/X208SC25055632-Z01-F001_01/ hassan@headnode01.omics.uni-luebeck.de:/data/humangen_kircherlab/hassan/novogene/
```

Use this if transfer breaks.
```python
rsync -avh --partial --inplace --progress /mnt/usb/X208SC25055632-Z01-F001_multipath/X208SC25055632-Z01-F001_01/ hassan@headnode01.omics.uni-luebeck.de:/data/humangen_kircherlab/hassan/novogene/
```

# Checking the md5 check sums.

```python
(base) hassan@node24:/data/humangen_kircherlab/hassan/novogene/md5check$ grep '\.fq\.gz$' md5sums_all.txt | awk '{gsub(/^\.\//, "", $2); print $1 "\t" $2}' | sort > my_c_md5.txt
(base) hassan@node24:/data/humangen_kircherlab/hassan/novogene/md5check$ grep '\.fq\.gz$' MD5.txt | awk '{print $1 "\t" $2}' > lab_c_md5.txt
cmp -s lab_c_md5.txt my_c_md5.txt && echo "‚úÖ All lines match!" || echo "‚ùå Differences found!"
‚úÖ All lines match!
```


# To check current running things in OMICS

```bash
squeue -u hassan -o "%.18i %.9P %.20j %.8u %.2t %.10M %.10L %.6D %.6C %.10m %R"```
